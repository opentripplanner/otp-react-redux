### The persistence setting is used to enable the storage of places (home, work),
### recent searches/places, user overrides, and favorite stops.
### Pick the strategy that best suits your needs.
###
### If you do not require remote storage of preferences,
### then use the localStorage strategy outlined below (which is used by default).
### The localStorage strategy will use the browser application storage.
### It must be enabled to show the stored locations (see above).
persistence:
  enabled: true
  strategy: localStorage

### If using the OTP Middleware to store user profiles
### with Auth0 as the authentication mechanism,
### then use the otp_middleware strategy below instead:
# persistence:

# The transitOperators key is a list of transit operators that can be used to
# order transit agencies when sorting by route. Also, this can optionally
# provide operator logos that appear in the the route viewer and itineraries).
# Note: these logos will override the values found in
# agency.txt#agency_branding_url.
#
# When sorting routes, otp-react-redux uses otp-ui's route-comparator which uses
# multiple criteria to sort routes. (See https://git.io/Jk2Ia). The routes are
# first sorted according to a comparator value based off of the agency. After
# sorting routes by the agency, additional sorting criteria is used for routes
# that yield the same agency comparator value.
#
# If the transitOperators key is not defined, route sorting will fall back to
# using the agency name. If the transitOperators key is defined, the order field
# defined for each agency is used as a comparator value. Agencies are matched
# according to both the feedId and agencyId. If no match is found or the order
# field is not undefined, the associated routes will be placed after all other
# agencies which did have a match with a defined order value.
#
# This works best with the IBI fork of OTP which returns the necessary
# information in the route index API. Check the build logs of OTP to see what
# feedIds and agencyIds were found as these IDs can sometimes be auto-generated.
#
# Shown below is an example transitOperators config setting for the Portland, OR
# area which uses 2 GTFS files (from TriMet and C-TRAN).
