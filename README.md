A library for writing modern [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/)-compatible multimodal journey planning applications using [React]() and [Redux]().

## Running the Example

An example of an OTP-RR application is included in the repository. The example project is a single page application with a root entry point of the `example.js` file. This example.js file can be modified to suit the needs of a particular implementation.

To run, first clone the repo and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if needed.

Update `example-config.yml` with the needed API keys, and optionally, the OTP endpoint and initial map origin. (The default values are for a test server for Portland, OR.).

Install the dependencies and start a local instance using the following script:

```bash
yarn start
```

Should you want to maintain multiple configuration files, OTP-RR can be made to use a custom config file by using environment variables. Other environment variables also exist. `CUSTOM_CSS` can be used to point to a css file to inject, and `JS_CONFIG` can be used to point to a `config.js` file to override the one shipped with OTP-RR.

```bash
env YAML_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/config.yml yarn start
```

## Deploying the UI

Build the js/css bundle by running `yarn build`. The build will appear in the `dist/` directory).

The same environment variables which affect the behavior of `yarn start` also affect `yarn build`. Running the following command builds OTP-RR with customized js and css:

```bash
env JS_CONFIG=my-custom-js.js CUSTOM_CSS=my-custom-css.css yarn build
```

## Internationalization

OTP-react-redux uses `react-intl` from the [`formatjs`](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs) library for internationalization.
Both `react-intl` and `formatjs` take advantage of native internationalization features provided by web browsers.

### `i18n` Folder

Language-specific content is located in YML files under the `i18n` folder
(e.g. `en-US.yml` for American English, `fr.yml` for generic French, etc.).

In each of these files:
  - Messages are organized in various categories and sub-categories.
  - A component or JS module can use messages from one or more categories.
  - In the code, messages are retrieved using an ID that is simply the path to the message.
    Use the dot '.' to separate categories and sub-categories in the path.
    For instance, for the message defined in YML below:
    ```yaml
    common
      modes
        subway: Metro
    ```
    then use the snippet below with the corresponding message id:
    ```jsx
    <FormattedMessage id="common.modes.subway" /> // renders "Metro".
    ```

In these YML files, it is important that message ids in the code be consistent with
the categories in this file. Below are some general guidelines:
  - For starters, there are an `actions`, `common`, `components`, and `config`
    categories. Additional categories may be added as needed.
  - Each sub-category under `components` denotes a React component and
    should contain messages that are used only by that component (e.g. button captions).
  - In contrast, some strings are common to multiple components,
    so it makes sense to group them by theme (e.g. accessModes) under the `common` category.

Note: Do not put comments in the YML files! They will be removed by `yaml-sort`.
Instead, comments for other developers should be placed in the corresponding js/jsx/ts/tsx file.
Comments for translators should be entered into Weblate (see [Contributing Translations](#contributing-translations))

### Internationalizable content in the configuration file

Most textual content from the `i18n` folder can also be customized on a per-configuration basis
using the `language` section of `config.yml`, whether for all languages at once,
or for each supported individual language.

### Using internationalizable content in the code

Use message id **literals** (no variables or other dynamic content) with either
```jsx
<FormattedMessage id="..." />
```
or
```js
intl.formatMessage({ id: ... })
```

The reason for passing **literals** to `FormattedMessage` and `intl.formatMessage` is that we have a checker script `yarn check:i18n` that is based on the `formatJS` CLI and that detects unused messages in the code and exports translation tables.
Passing variables or dynamic content will cause the `formatJS` CLI and the checker to ignore the corresponding messages and
incorrectly claim that a string is unused or missing from a translation file.

One exception to this rule concerns configuration settings where message ids can be constructed dynamically.

Translations from the community are welcome and very much appreciated,
please see instructions at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/otp-react-redux/.
Community input from Weblate will appear as pull requests with changes to files in the `i18n` folder for our review.
(Contributions may be edited or rejected to remain in line with long-term project goals.)

If changes to a specific language file is needed but not enabled in Weblate, please open an issue or a pull request with the changes needed.

## Library Documentation

More coming soon...

As of version 2.0, otp-react-redux utilizes React's context API in a number of components. This changed the way that some components receive props such that they will not work properly unless wrapped with the context provider used in the `ResponsiveWebapp` component.
